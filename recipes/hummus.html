      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>“Michael, make me hummus.” “Michael, can you please make hummus?” “Michael, seriously… make me hummus.” Ever since I first made my wife hummus a couple of months ago, she has been begging me to make it again and again. This stuff really is addicting, and the best part, it is cheap and super easy to make. Just throw everything into a food processor or a blender and then seconds later, you have the perfect Mediterranean dip to serve along with celery, pita chips, carrots, or our favorite, sweet peppers. This is a perfect dip to make for your next party. I hope you enjoy it as much as my wife does!</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 can drained chickpeas</li>
          <li>1/2 cup good quality extra virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>1/2 cup tahini</li>
          <li>1 lemon juiced</li>
          <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
          <li>3/4 teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
          <li>1-2 tablespoons of water</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Drain your can of chickpeas and rinse with water, you can use a strainer for this step.</li>
          <li>Peel your garlic, juice lemon, measure out all ingredients.</li>
          <li>Put all ingredients (except water) into a food processor or a blender and pulse until well combined and at your desired consistency. If you would like to thin your hummus, you can add a tablespoon or two of water. If desired, add more salt and more lemon juice to your taste.</li>
