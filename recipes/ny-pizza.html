      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I have been on a journey to perfect homemade pizza. While I am still trying to perfect the perfect Neopolatin-style Margherita pizza using my Ooni Koda Pizza Oven, both my wife and I are confident that I have perfected how to make the perfect New York slice at home in a normal oven. This is a comprehensive guide on how to make your very own perfect New York Style Pizza in the comfort of your own home. The process is a bit long, but believe me, it is fun, satisfying, and it is worth it!</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href=master-pizza-dough.html>Master Pizza Dough</a> or <a href="sourdough-pizza-dough.html">Sourdough Pizza Dough</a></li>
          <li>1 28-Ounce Can of High-Quality Canned Whole San Marzano or Plum Tomatoes</li>
          <li>1/4 cup of Tomato Paste</li>
          <li>1 tsp of Kosher Salt (plus more to suit your taste)</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp of Garlic Powder</li>
          <li>1 tsp Dried Basil</li>
          <li>2 tsp Dried Oregano</li>
          <li>1 tbsp of High-Quality Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
          <li>8 oz of Whole Milk Low Moisture Mozzarella</li>
          <li>4 oz of Natural Casing Pepperoni (Optional)</li>
          <li>Parmesan Reggiano (Optional, enough to suit your taste)</li>
          <li><a href="fermented-garlic-honey.html">Garlic Honey</a> (Optional, drizzle to your liking)</li>
          <li>Crushed Red Pepper Flakes (Optional, enough to suit your taste)</li>
          <li>About a 1/4 cup of Semolina Flour or Corn Meal (Highly recommend Semolina Flour if you can find it, enough to stretch the dough and dust your peel)</li>
          <li>About 1/4 cup of All-purpose Flour (Mix this with the semolina flour for stretching and dusting your peel)</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>One hour prior to baking your pizzas, place pizza stones in the oven. Place one on the highest rack, about 4 inches from the top of the oven. Place the other on the lowest rack, about 4 inches from the bottom of the oven. If you are only using one stone, place it on the highest rack. Set your oven to its highest temperature, preferably 500-550°F.</li>
          <li>Remove your premade dough from the fridge and reshape it into balls with a smooth top. Lightly dust the ball with all-purpose flour, place in a room-temperature spot, cover with a tea towel and let proof for at least 1 hour.</li>
          <li>As the oven is heating and your dough is proofing, start making the New York-style pizza sauce. Open your can of tomatoes and drain off most of the tomato juice the tomatoes are suspended in, it is okay to leave some of this juice, the more juice you leave the thinner the sauce, so if you like a really thick sauce remove more of the juice.</li>
          <li>If you have an immersion blender you can do this next step in the can, but if you don’t place the tomatoes, remaining juice, tomato paste, kosher salt, garlic powder, dried basil, dried oregano, and olive oil in a food processor or blender. Blend until your desired consistency, if you like a smooth sauce, blend longer, if you like a chunky sauce, less. Traditionally, New York-style sauce is very smooth. For this step, I actually used a potato masher because I wanted a really chunky sauce.</li>
          <li>As your flavors are marinating together in the sauce, the oven is continuing to pre-heat and your dough is still proofing, prep your toppings. Shred your mozzarella cheese using your cheese grater, cut your pepperoni to your desired thickness (I think the thinner the better), and grate your Parmesan Reggiano using a micro plane or by placing a chuck in your blender and blending at high speed for a couple of seconds to break it up to a size that you can sprinkle it easily over your pie.</li>
          <li>Mix about a 1/4 cup of semolina flour (cornmeal works too, but I prefer semolina) and a 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour together. Sprinkle some of the flour mixture on a clean countertop, or cutting board, and your pizza peel. Position all of your toppings, sauce, and proofed dough in a way you will be able to easily access each of them since you have to work kind of fast to prevent your dough from sticking to your pizza peel.</li>
          <li>Once your dough has properly proofed for one hour, place it on your floured surface. Coat the ball with your flour mixture and from the center of the dough begin to press and stretch your dough out into a fairly flat disc, the middle should be thinner than the edges. You can also pick up the dough and let it droop over the back of your hand and let gravity stretch the dough. During this process, coat the dough with more flour to prevent sticking. Once your dough is about 12-14 inches wide, place it on top of your pizza peel. Using a fairly large and flattish spoon, add about 2-3 spoonfuls of sauce and spread over your dough. The amount you use is your preference. Optionally sprinkle on grated Parmesan Reggiano, again the amount is whatever you desire.</li>
          <li>Sprinkle a handful or two of your grated mozzarella so that it covers the sauce. Optionally, you can also add your sliced pepperoni at this stage, they shrink up quite a bit so the more the better.</li>
          <li>Quickly, open your oven, and using the pizza peel, shimmy it onto the top stone. Close your oven and let it cook for about 5 minutes. Try not to open your oven too often to check on it because you will lose heat, but a couple of times is okay. If you have a second pizza peel, as this pizza is cooking, repeat steps 7 and 8. Using your empty peel, transfer the baking pizza to the bottom stone, and place the new pizza on the top stone. Cook for another 5 minutes. If you are making a third pizza, repeat steps 7 and 8 again.</li>
          <li>After your pizza has been in the oven for a total of about 10 minutes, remove and place on a cutting board or a pizza sheet pan. Let sit for at least 5 minutes, then cut and serve. Repeat for the rest of your pizzas. For a special flavor kick to your mouth, drizzle <a href="fermented-garlic-honey.html">garlic honey</a> over the pizza. Enjoy!</li>
