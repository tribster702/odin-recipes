      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love this quick sourdough pizza dough recipe. Also, I do not know if sourdough pizza dough is grammatically correct, so for the rest of the post, I will just refer to it as sourdough. Anywho, I’ve been experimenting with sourdough throughout the COVID-19 season and I’ve had a blast trying different things like this pizza dough recipe. I found that this recipe is amazing for homemade <a href="ny-pizza.html">New York style pizza</a>. Not only is it easy, but in only 12 to 24 hours, you have an incredibly flavorful dough with a perfect texture. I hope you enjoy!</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>350 grams of bread flour (about 2 3/4 cups)</li>
          <li>225 grams of mature sourdough starter (about 1 cup)</li>
          <li>180 grams of ice-cold water (about 3/4 cup)</li>
          <li>25 grams of sugar or honey (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
          <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
          <li>13 grams of high-quality extra virgin olive oil plus extra for greasing bowls (about 1 tablespoon)</li>
          <li>12 grams of kosher salt (about 2 teaspoons)</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>The first step is to measure out 225 grams (or 1 cup) of mature sourdough starter. Note, if you do not have a mature sourdough starter, it is a process that will take about a week. I recommend this sourdough starter. After carefully following the directions that came with it, I personally had great success. Alternatively, King Arthur Baking has a great recipe as well.</li>
          <li>In a food processor, stand mixer, or large bowl, add flour, starter, water, and sugar or honey. If using a food processor, use the pulse setting about 5-10 times until the dough comes together. If using a stand mixer or large bowl and wooden spoon, mix for about 1 minute until a rough ball of dough forms.</li>
          <li>Add olive oil and salt. Pulse about 5 times if using a food processor or mix for about 1 minute if using a stand mixer or large bowl and wooden spoon, or until fully incorporated. Cover and let the dough sit for about 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>Transfer dough to a lightly oiled surface. The dough is very sticky, but do your best to form it into a large ball with a smooth top. Cover with a tea towel or large bowl and let sit for about 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into 3 equal parts. Form each part into a ball with a smooth top. Place the dough balls into 3 very lightly oiled glass bowls, or into a lightly greased cake pan that has a lid.</li>
          <li>Cover with a lid and place into a refrigerator to ferment overnight, or around 12-24 hours. The longer you ferment, the better. 1 hour before you want to make pizza, remove the dough from the fridge, reform it into balls with smooth tops, cover and let proof for 1 hour. Again, it works great with my <a href="ny-pizza.html">New York style pizza</a> recipe. Enjoy!</li>
