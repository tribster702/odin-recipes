      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This stuff is magic. I first came across the concept of fermented garlic honey while watching Brad Leone’s It’s Alive series on Bon Appétit. Brad is easily my favorite YouTube chef, there is something about the way he loves food, much like a child, that makes it a joy to watch him cook. A few years ago a made a batch of his garlic honey and it blew my mind. I couldn’t believe how something so easy and simple could be so complex. Incredibly, all you need for this recipe are 5 things, a jar, a lid, honey, and a few cloves of freshly peeled garlic cloves. Try this drizzled on grilled chicken or on a slice of homemade New York-style pepperoni pizza, you will not be disappointed.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
          <li>1/2 cup good quality organic local honey</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Peel and lightly crush 5 cloves of garlic, place in an 8-ounce jar. To easily remove the skin around the garlic, place an unpeeled clove on a flat surface and press moderately hard with the palm of your hand. This will lightly crush the clove and easily allow you to remove the skin. No need to cut off the bottom of the cloves.</li>
          <li>Measure out honey and pour into the jar over the cloves of garlic.</li>
          <li>Screw on airtight lid. Take note of the day you made the garlic honey. Store garlic honey in a dry area out of direct sunlight and allow it to ferment for 2-3 days. Burp the jar, it will be producing gases in the fermentation process. Continue to burp once every day or two. After about 5 days, your garlic honey will be ready to use. I highly recommend drizzling over New York-style pepperoni pizza, it is life-changing, enjoy!</li>
